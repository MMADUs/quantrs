## SymEngine Integration Notes

- Successfully patched `symengine-sys` for macOS compatibility
- The `dwave` feature is properly gated and optional
- All SymEngine-dependent functionality is behind `#[cfg(feature = "dwave")]` gates

### Build Requirements for SymEngine

When building with symengine dependencies on macOS, set these environment variables:

```bash
export SYMENGINE_DIR=$(brew --prefix symengine)
export GMP_DIR=$(brew --prefix gmp)
export MPFR_DIR=$(brew --prefix mpfr)
export BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS="-I$(brew --prefix symengine)/include -I$(brew --prefix gmp)/include -I$(brew --prefix mpfr)/include"
```

### Remaining SymEngine Tasks

- [ ] Complete the patching of the `symengine` crate to work with our patched `symengine-sys`
- [ ] Fix type and function reference issues in `symengine` crate
- [ ] Test compatibility with the D-Wave system

For more details on the D-Wave integration, refer to the documentation in the `quantrs-anneal` crate.
